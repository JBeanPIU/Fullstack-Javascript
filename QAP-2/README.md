Hi!

This is my submission for QAP 2 of Fullstack Javascript, a bit rushed so I may have missed a few features/some may not work as intended.

This is a math competition app using EJS to create a web browser with Javascript, the entire purpose is to have randomly generated math questions and try to get as high 
of a score you can! (it works generally on a win streak system)

Fairly simple concept but the coding itself was rough lol, was def lost at multiple points.

To run, you must make sure to have node_modules setup, you can do that by going into terminal and typing `npm install`

from there:

`cd "QAP-2/math-competition-app"`
`npm start`

*you can skip adding the QAP-2 or replace it with any other folder you've placed it inside of*

Taking almost 9 straight hours of coding, I'm now going to take a single day to recuperate. 

Thanks for taking a look, still not great with Fullstack but I think I'm slowly getting better!
